Hi. 

<!--more-->

#### so this website is set and working properly

Hi! you might be seeing this because:
- either you got curious and wanted to check out my first post
- you randomly found this (low chance)
- you are me, who reads this 


ok so, this site is made with hugo (if you don't know hugo is a framework for building websites). even i dont know much to be honest. you might ask why you don't know much, harsh? and i will respond that i Vibe coded more than Half of this! 

one of my main focus is reduce my dependence on AI, atleast for coding.

anyways! enought mental tangents..

 let me introduce myself.

i am Harshvardhan Maurya, and i'm a cybersecurity enthusiast. i like Cybersecuritry and i am still deciding what specialization to go to.
who knows? maybe i will go to blue teaming, maybe i will go to red teaming.. or maybe i will  go to complaince... Life is never fixed.

i'm daily driving arch linux right now and i have a bunch of DE's and WM's installed. i'm still learning all this things and using AI to help me (which is slowly being replaced by reading of documentation)  and (trying to)focus on academics
